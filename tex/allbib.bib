title={Scalable ∊-optimal self-organization in communicating swarms using implicit probabilistic automata},
year={2012},
pages={6047-6052},
abstract={The problem of scalable near-optimal distributed control of swarms is investigated with emphasis on decentralized ε-optimal path planning to locally sensed targets. The proposed algorithm only uses information that can be locally queried, and rigorous theoretical results on convergence, robustness, scalability are established, and effect of system parameters such as the agent-level communication radius and agent velocities on global performance is analyzed. The fundamental philosophy of the proposed approach is to percolate local information across the swarm, enabling agents to indirectly access the global context A gradient emerges, reflecting the performance of agents, computed in a distributed manner via local information exchange between neighboring agents. It is shown that to follow near-optimal routes to a target which can be only sensed locally, and whose location is not known a priori, the agents need to simply move towards its “best” neighbor, where the notion of “best” is obtained by computing the state-specific language measure of an underlying probabilistic finite state automata. The theoretical results are validated in high-fidelity simulation experiments, with a minimum of 104 agents. Several controlled behaviors of interest are demonstrated in simulation which go beyond rendezvous-type scenarios, thus potentially laying the framework to complex collaborative task execution by large scale engineered swarms in near future.},

abstract={A semantic framework for information fusion in sensor networks for object and situation assessment is proposed. The overall vision is to construct machine representations that would enable human-like perceptual understanding of observed scenes via fusion of heterogeneous sensor data. In this regard, a hierarchical framework is proposed that is based on the Data Fusion Information Group (DFIG) model. Unlike a simple set-theoretic information fusion methodology that leads to loss of information, relational dependencies are modeled as cross-machines called relational Probabilistic Finite State Automata using the xD-Markov machine construction. This leads to a tractable approach for modeling composite patterns as structured sets for both object and scene representation. An illustrative example demonstrates the superior capability of the proposed methodology for pattern classification in urban scenarios.},

pages={942-948},
abstract={Identifying meaningful signal buried in noise is a problem of interest arising in diverse scenarios of data-driven modeling. We present here a theoretical framework for exploiting intrinsic geometry in data that resists noise corruption, and might be identifiable under severe obfuscation. Our approach is based on uncovering a valid complete inner product on the space of ergodic stationary finite valued processes, providing the latter with the structure of a Hilbert space on the real field. This rigorous construction, based on non-standard generalizations of the notions of sum and scalar multiplication of finite dimensional probability vectors, allows us to meaningfully talk about "angles" between data streams and data sources, and, make precise the notion of orthogonal stochastic processes. In particular, the relative angles appear to be preserved, and identifiable, under severe noise, and will be developed in future as the underlying principle for robust classification, clustering and unsupervised featurization algorithms.},

abstract={This paper formulates a self-organization algorithm to address the problem of global behavior supervision in engineered swarms of arbitrarily large population sizes. The swarms considered in this paper are assumed to be homogeneous collections of independent identical finite-state agents, each of which is modeled by an irreducible finite Markov chain. The proposed algorithm computes the necessary perturbations in the local agents' behavior, which guarantees convergence to the desired observed state of the swarm. The ergodicity property of the swarm, which is induced as a result of the irreducibility of the agent models, implies that while the local behavior of the agents converges to the desired behavior only in the time average, the overall swarm behavior converges to the specification and stays there at all times. A simulation example illustrates the underlying concept.},

title={Computing entropy rate of symbol sources & a distribution-free limit theorem},
year={2014},
pages={1-6},
abstract={Entropy rate of sequential data-streams naturally quantifies the complexity of the generative process. Thus entropy rate fluctuations could be used as a tool to recognize dynamical perturbations in signal sources, and could potentially be carried out without explicit background noise characterization. However, state of the art algorithms to estimate the entropy rate have markedly slow convergence; making such entropic approaches non-viable in practice. We present here a fundamentally new approach to estimate entropy rates, which is demonstrated to converge significantly faster in terms of input data lengths, and is shown to be effective in diverse applications ranging from the estimation of the entropy rate of English texts to the estimation of complexity of chaotic dynamical systems. Additionally, the convergence rate of entropy estimates do not follow from any standard limit theorem, and reported algorithms fail to provide any confidence bounds on the computed values. Exploiting a connection to the theory of probabilistic automata, we establish a convergence rate of O(log|s|/3√|s|) as a function of the input length |s|, which then yields explicit uncertainty estimates, as well as required data lengths to satisfy pre-specified confidence bounds.},

title={GODDeS: Globally ∈-Optimal Routing Via Distributed Decision-theoretic Self-organization},
year={2011},
pages={3215-3220},
abstract={This paper introduces GODDeS: a fully distributed self-organizing decision-theoretic routing algorithm designed to effectively exploit high quality paths in lossy ad-hoc wireless environments, typically with a large number of nodes. The routing problem is modeled as an optimal control problem for a decentralized Markov Decision Process, with links characterized by locally known packet drop probabilities that either remain constant on average or change slowly. The equivalence of this optimization problem to that of performance maximization of an explicitly constructed probabilistic automata allows us to effectively apply the theory of quantitative measures of probabilistic regular languages, and design a distributed highly efficient solution approach that attempts to minimize source to-sink drop probabilities across the network. Theoretical results provide rigorous guarantees on global performance, showing that the algorithm achieves near-global optimality, in polynomial time. It is also argued that GODDeS is significantly congestion-aware, and exploits multi-path routes optimally. Theoretical development is supported by high-fidelity network simulations.},

pages={2403-2408},
abstract={The v*-planning algorithm is generalized to handle finite memory obstacle dynamics. A sufficiently long observation sequence of obstacle dynamics is algorithmically compressed via symbolic dynamic filtering to obtain a probabilistic finite state model which is subsequently integrated with the navigation automaton to generate an overall model reflecting both navigation constraints and obstacle dynamics. A v*-based solution then yields a deterministic plan that maximizes the difference of the probabilities of reaching the goal and of hitting an obstacle. The approach is validated by simulated solution of dynamic mazes.},

title={Pattern classification in symbolic streams via semantic annihilation of information},
year={2010},
pages={492-497},
abstract={We propose a technique for pattern identification in symbolic streams via selective erasure of observed symbols, in cases where the patterns of interest are represented as Probabilistic Finite State Automata (PFSA). We define an additive abelian group for a slightly restricted set of probabilistic machines, and the group sum is used to formulate pattern-specific semantic annihilators. The annihilators attempt to identify pre-specified patterns via removal of inter-symbol correlations from observed sequences, thereby turning them into symbolic white noise. Thus a perfect annihilation corresponds to a pattern match. This approach of classification via information annihilation is shown to be strictly advantageous, with theoretical guarantees, for a large class of PFSA models. The results are supported by simulation experiments.},

The modified algorithm called All-Pair-Dynamic-Planning(APDP), models the problem of robot path planning in the framework of finite state probabilistic automata and solves the all-pair planning problem in one setting. We use the concept of renormalized measure of regular languages to plan paths with automated trade-off between path length and robustness under dynamic uncertainties, from any starting location to any goal in the given map. The dynamic updating feature of APDP efficiently updates path plans to incorporate newly learnt information about the working environment.},

	abstract = {As we begin to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, a key question is if we can avert such disasters in future. Current surveillance protocols generally focus on qualitative impact assessments of viral diversity 1. These efforts are primarliy aimed at ecosystem and human impact monitoring, and do not help to precisely quantify emergence. Currently, the similarity of biological strains is measured by the edit distance or the number of mutations that separate their genomic sequences 2{\textendash}6, e.g. the number of mutations that make an avian flu strain human-adapted. However, ignoring the odds of those mutations in the wild keeps us blind to the true jump risk, and gives us little indication of which strains are more risky. In this study, we develop a more meaningful metric for comparison of genomic sequences. Our metric, the q-distance, precisely quantifies the probability of spontaneous jump by random chance. Learning from patterns of mutations from large sequence databases, the q-distance adapts to the specific organism, the background population, and realistic selection pressures; demonstrably improving inference of ancestral relationships and future trajectories. As important application, we show that the q-distance predicts future strains for seasonal Influenza, outperforming World Health Organization (WHO) recommended flu-shot composition almost consistently over two decades. Such performance is demonstrated separately for Northern and Southern hemisphere for different subtypes, and key capsidic proteins. Additionally, we investigate the SARS-CoV-2 origin problem, and precisely quantify the likelihood of different animal species that hosted an immediate progenitor, producing a list of related species of bats that have a quantifiably high likelihood of being the source. Additionally, we identify specific rodents with a credible likelihood of hosting a SARS-CoV-2 ancestor. Combining machine learning and large deviation theory, the analysis reported here may open the door to actionable predictions of future pandemics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is funded in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project $\#$FP070943-01-PR.
